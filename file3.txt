OOPSLA is the annual conference for Object Oriented Programming Systems, Languages and Applications.


Criticism of OOP
The object oriented programming model has been criticized by developers for multiple reasons. The largest concern is that OOP overemphasizes the data component of software development and does not focus enough on computation or algorithms. Additionally, OOP code may be more complicated to write and take longer to compile.

Alternative methods to OOP include:

functional programming
structured programming
imperative programming
Most advanced programming languages give developers the option to combine these models.
